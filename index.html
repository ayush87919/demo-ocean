                <p class ="text-small">No matter where we live, the ocean is essential to our lives. It supplies 50% of the oxygen we breathe and is the home
                     to fish and other species that provide food and income for more than three billion people. Its coral reefs and oyster beds shelter marine
                      life and protect our shores by breaking up wave energy and storm surges.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big ">1.Skip the single-use plastics</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Single-use plastics—such as non-reusable water bottles, take-out packaging, plastic bags, and straws—pollute our ocean
            and can destroy ecosystems and endanger marine life. With 8 million tons of plastic dumped into the ocean each year, there could be a pound of plastic
             for every three pounds of fish in the ocean within the next decade alone. To minimize your impact, remove unnecessary single-use plastics from your
              daily habits. Even eliminating straws could go a long way towards reducing ocean debris. If every American sipped out of just five fewer straws per
               year, we could keep more than 1.5 billion straws out of landfills—and our ocean.</p>

       <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Consider booking your next trip through a responsible travel company that’s committed to protecting wildlife, empowering
        local communities, and using guides who are aware of rules and best practices. Once you arrive at your destination, be respectful of marine life and
         habitats, such as nesting sea turtles on beaches and sensitive coral reef systems. And be discerning about your purchases. Purchasing certain items,
          such as coral jewelry, shark products, or tortoiseshell accessories (made from endangered hawksbill turtles) damages fragile ecosystems and threatens
           critically endangered species.</p>

    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The more you learn about the ocean, the better prepared you’ll be to inspire change—and help others do the same. 
    Thankfully, there are many ways to educate yourself about the ocean and the challenges it faces, from books and documentaries 
    to websites, museums, art exhibits, and more. If you’re an educator, check out WWF’s Wild Classroom, an online library of specially designed tools that
     will help you bring ocean conservation to your school.</p>
